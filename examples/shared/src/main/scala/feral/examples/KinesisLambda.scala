/**
 * On Scala.js, implement your Lambda as an `object`. This will be the name your JavaScript
 * function is exported as. On JVM, implement your Lambda as a `class`.
 *
 * Every Lambda is triggered by an `Event` for which there must be a circe `Decoder[Event]`. It
 * should then return `Some[Result]` for which there must be a circe `Encoder[Result]`. If your
 * Lambda has no result (as is often the case), use `INothing` and return `None` in the handler.
 *
 * Models for events/results are provided in the `feral.lambda.events` package. There are many
 * more to implement! Please consider contributing to
 * [[https://github.com/typelevel/feral/issues/48 #48]].
 *
 * For a more advanced example, see the `Http4sLambda` next.
